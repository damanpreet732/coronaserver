<h1 align="center">How to Protect Yourself & Others</h1>
<h2>Know how it spreads</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li>There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).</li><br/>
<li><strong>The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.</strong></li><br/>
<li>The virus is thought to spread mainly from person to person.</li><br/>
<ul typr="circle">
<li>Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).</li><br/>
<li>Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks.</li><br/>
<li>These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.</li><br/>
<li>Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Everyone Should</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>Wash your hands often</strong> with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li><br/>
<li>It’s especially important to wash:</li>
<ul type="circle">
<li>Before eating or preparing food.</li><br/>
<li>Before touching your face</li><br/>
<li>After using the restroom</li><br/>
<li>After leaving a public place</li><br/>
<li>After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing</li><br/>
<li>After handling your mask</li><br/>
<li>After changing a diaper</li><br/>
<li>After caring for someone sick</li><br/>
<li>After touching animals or pets</li><br/>
</ul>
<li>If soap and water are not readily available, <strong>use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</strong> Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Avoid close contact</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>Inside your home:</strong> Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li><br/>
<ul type="circle">
<li>If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other household members.</li><br/>
</ul>
<li><strong>Outside your home:</strong> Put 6 feet of distance between yourself and people who don’t live in your household.</li><br/>
<ul type="circle">
<li>Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus.</li><br/>
<li>Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) from other people.</li><br/>
<li>Keeping distance from others is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Cover your mouth and nose with a mask when around others</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li>You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick.</li><br/>
<li>The mask is meant to protect other people in case you are infected.</li><br/>
<li>Everyone should wear a mask in public settings and when around people who don’t live in your household, especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.</li><br/>
<ul type="circle">
<li>Masks should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.</li><br/>
</ul>
<li>Do NOT use a mask meant for a healthcare worker. Currently, surgical masks and N95 respirators are critical supplies that should be reserved for healthcare workers and other first responders.</li><br/>
<li>Continue to keep about 6 feet between yourself and others. The mask is not a substitute for social distancing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cover coughs and sneezes</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>Always cover your mouth and nose</strong> with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow and do not spit.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Throw used tissues</strong> in the trash.</li><br/>
<li>Immediately <strong>wash your hands</strong> with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Monitor Your Health Daily</h2>
<ul type="disc">
<li><strong>Be alert for symptoms.</strong> Watch for fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of COVID-19.</li><br/>
<ul type="circle">
<li>Especially important if you are running essential errands, going into the office or workplace, and in settings where it may be difficult to keep a physical distance of 6 feet.</li><br/>
</ul>
<li><strong>Take your temperature</strong> if symptoms develop.</li><br/>
<li>Don’t take your temperature within 30 minutes of exercising or after taking medications that could lower your temperature, like acetaminophen.</li>
</ul>
